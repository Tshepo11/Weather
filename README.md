Showing weather details for your current location

Capturing your GPS coordinates can be very slow depending on your location, I am still working on this app 
VS Code/Sublime,

To search your location: 
fetch('https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q='+InputValue.value+'&appid=62d518c7b1dea218d3ac8510de571407')
Busy implementing this functionality
